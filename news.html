<h2> Mac OS Big Sur has telemetry </h2>
<p> Hey mac users! Apple has stuck telemetry into Mac OS Big Sur. </p>
<p> With software like "little snitch" being useless because of the measures Apple has stuck in MacOS Big Sur. </p>
<p> Not only did Little Snitch become useless but VPNs can no longer help either. As apple put measures in to prevent VPNs from stopping the data collection as well. </p>
<p> If you are scared about being spied on maybe try installing Windows or Linux on your macbook or iMac :D </p>
